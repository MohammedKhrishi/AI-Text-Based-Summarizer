# AI-Text-Based-Summarizer

React.js is a JavaScript library used to create the frontend of a single-page web application. 
It reduces the complexity of an application by dividing the UI into small and more manageable components. In this project, instead of using npx create-react-app app-name command, we will use $ npm create vite@latest
 to install all dependencies.
